Project Ankitan

National Land Knowledge & Dispute Resolution Repository

Created by Kallol Chakrabarti, Global Independent Researcher

1. Overview

Project Ankitan is a structured national repository designed to support the implementation of the SVAMITVA Scheme by integrating verified historical, transactional, and community land records with digitized cadastral data.

It addresses a core challenge in rural land governance: incomplete legacy records leading to title disputes, delayed mutation, and limited access to land-based financing.

2. Problem Statement

While the SVAMITVA initiative accelerates drone-based mapping and property card issuance, several implementation gaps persist:

Historical land boundaries not aligned with current digitized maps

Informal or undocumented transactions affecting title clarity

Community-held knowledge not captured in formal systems

Dispute resolution delays due to fragmented data sources

Limited bankability of land parcels due to record inconsistencies

A structured integration layer is needed to validate and augment digitized land records.

3. Solution Framework

Project Ankitan proposes a national repository that:

Aggregates verified historical and transactional land data

Digitizes and standardizes legacy village records

Maps traditional boundary knowledge with geo-referenced survey data

Flags discrepancies for administrative review

Creates a dispute-resolution data support layer

Enhances credit readiness of rural land parcels

The repository acts as an augmentation framework, not a replacement of state land record systems.

4. Core Objectives

Strengthen title certainty under SVAMITVA

Reduce litigation and boundary disputes

Enable land-based financing through validated records

Provide a replicable integration model for all states

Support Department of Land Resources with a scalable data architecture

5. Key Components

Historical Record Digitization Module

Transaction Validation & Cross-Referencing Engine

Community Knowledge Verification Layer

Dispute Analytics Dashboard

Credit-Readiness Certification Index

6. Implementation Approach

Phase 1: Data ingestion and validation
Phase 2: Geo-referencing and reconciliation with drone survey outputs
Phase 3: Administrative review and dispute flagging
Phase 4: Credit enablement tagging for financial institutions

7. Expected Impact

Improved accuracy of rural property cards

Reduced dispute resolution timelines

Increased formal credit penetration in rural areas

Greater transparency in village land governance

Model integration framework for nationwide adoption

8. Alignment with National Priorities

Project Ankitan complements:

SVAMITVA Scheme implementation

Digital India land record modernization

Rural economic formalization

Financial inclusion initiatives

9. Governance Model

The repository is designed to operate as:

A federated integration framework

State-enabled but nationally standardized

Auditable and legally referenceable

Scalable across districts and states

10. Conclusion

Project Ankitan bridges legacy land knowledge with modern digitized records. By creating a structured, verified, and finance-ready data layer, it strengthens rural land governance and supports dispute-free, credit-enabled property ownership across India.
